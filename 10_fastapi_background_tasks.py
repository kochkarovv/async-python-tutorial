FastAPI Background Tasks Example - Simplified Version
Advanced Asyncio Tutorial: Chapter 10

TUTORIAL EXPLANATION:
====================

FastAPI Background Tasks - Simple Non-blocking Execution

This simplified example demonstrates FastAPI's background tasks feature with
basic synchronous operations. The key concept is that HTTP responses return
immediately while background jobs run after the response is sent.

KEY CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED:
- FastAPI BackgroundTasks: Non-blocking task execution
- Response-first pattern: Return HTTP response immediately  
- Multiple background jobs from single endpoint
- Synchronous operations in background (time.sleep)
- Simple logging to show task execution timing

THE POWER OF BACKGROUND TASKS:
When you call the endpoint:
1. HTTP response returns immediately (~5-10ms)
2. Two background jobs start after response is sent
3. Job 1: Runs for 3 seconds, then logs completion
4. Job 2: Runs for 6 seconds, then logs completion
5. User doesn't wait for the jobs to complete

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
- Send email notifications
- Process uploaded files
- Update databases
- Generate reports
- Clean up temporary data

PERFORMANCE BENEFIT:
- User gets instant feedback
- Heavy work happens in background
- API stays responsive under load
